        Hello, my name is Radha Hosad, and I am a Masters student at American University, where I am pursuing an MA in Literature, Culture, and Technology on the Game Design Track, on track to graduate this May. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree from American University where I was a double major in both Literature, on the Transcultural studies track, and CLEG (Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government). 
        I am deeply passionate about media analysis and Game Design. If you click on the Writings button, you can see my media analysis papers on various topics, from animation to video games to songs to classic novels. If you click on the games button, you can play the various games I have created! Please have a look at my resume on the right, and feel free to email me at Radha.Hosad@gmail.com for more information!
